On the backend, I developed robust microservices using Java and Spring Boot, creating RESTful APIs that ensured reliability and scalability. On the frontend, I crafted dynamic user interfaces with React, focusing on reusable components to deliver consistent, responsive experiences across devices.

To handle the massive scale of operations, I architected AWS cloud-native systems using EC2, Lambda, and RDS to process terabytes of data. I optimized storage and retrieval strategies on AWS S3 and DynamoDB, enhancing real-time data access and improving efficiency. My work extended to automating the development lifecycle through CI/CD pipelines built with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, which streamlined build, test, and deployment processes, cutting down development time significantly.

As a problem-solver, I routinely diagnosed and resolved production issues through root cause analysis and debugging, ensuring system stability and reliability. I also took pride in fostering team collaboration by authoring API documentation and system designs. This effort not only expedited onboarding for new developers but also improved project delivery timelines.

At its core, my work at PwC was about creating scalable, reliable, and user-centric solutionsâ€”turning complex challenges into streamlined systems that delivered results.`,

My primary responsibility was developing secure REST APIs using Spring Boot, with OAuth2 integration to ensure the security of sensitive healthcare data. These APIs seamlessly connected with third-party systems, meeting stringent compliance standards and maintaining system reliability under heavy usage."

"On the frontend, I developed modular and responsive UI components using Angular and Bootstrap. These components were designed with a focus on cross-platform compatibility and aligned with WCAG accessibility standards to ensure inclusivity. One of my key contributions was a dynamic patient dashboard that streamlined workflows and enhanced user satisfaction by providing a clean and intuitive interface."

"Performance optimization was another critical aspect of my role. I optimized backend services using advanced data structures and fine-tuned SQL queries to significantly reduce response times. For instance, through query optimization and indexing, I achieved a 30% improvement in data retrieval speed, which was pivotal in supporting real-time operations in enterprise systems."

"In addition to development, I actively automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using Jenkins and Docker. This automation not only accelerated delivery cycles but also ensured consistent environments across development and production stages, minimizing errors and downtime."

"Working in an Agile environment, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions on time. I participated in sprint planning, backlog grooming, and daily standups, contributing to a culture of continuous improvement and efficient problem-solving."

"In summary, my role at DXC Technology allowed me to demonstrate a balanced skill set as a full-stack developer, delivering secure, performant, and user-centric solutions while ensuring operational efficiency and cross-functional collaboration.`,
